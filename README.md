# REST API Login
The "REST API Login" with JSON Web Token project is an application developed with a focus on user security and authentication, using technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and JWT. This project highlights the use of encryption frameworks to ensure data security and user login information integrity.

At the core of this project is Node.js, serving as the foundation for the application's backend. Express.js is employed to streamline routing, middleware, and request processing, facilitating the development of a robust and scalable REST API. Additionally, encryption frameworks such as bcrypt.js or similar are utilized to secure user passwords during storage in the database.

User authentication is performed through JSON Web Token (JWT), an open standard that enables secure transmission of information between parties through digitally signed JSON objects. The use of JWT provides an effective solution for authenticating users and authorizing access to protected resources within the application.

In addition to authentication, the project may also include features such as user registration, password recovery, and session management. These operations are implemented securely, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user information at all points of interaction with the API.

Through the development of this project, developers gain valuable experience in web application security, user authentication, and the use of encryption frameworks. They learn to protect sensitive user data and ensure the integrity of information at all stages of the authentication and authorization process.

In summary, the REST API Login with JSON Web Token project highlights the use of encryption frameworks to ensure data security and user login information integrity, providing a robust and scalable solution for authentication in web applications.
